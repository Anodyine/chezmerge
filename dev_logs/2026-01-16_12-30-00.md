## TUI Enhancements
- **Copy/Paste**: Implemented `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` using Textual's clipboard integration.
- **Navigation**: Added `ctrl+t` to cycle focus between panes (Theirs -> Base -> Ours -> Template).
- **External Editor**: Added `ctrl+m` to launch `nvim`, `vim`, or `vi`.
    - Implementation uses `subprocess` to open the 4 panes in tabs (`-p`).
    - *Decision*: Reverted `ctrl+w` (Window) and `ctrl+e` (Edit) proposals back to `ctrl+t` and `ctrl+m` due to terminal emulator conflicts (Delete Word / End of Line).

## Testing
- Created `tests/manual/04_auto_merge.md`.
- **Workflow Verification**:
    - Confirmed that non-conflicting upstream changes are merged automatically without launching the TUI.
    - Updated test documentation to reflect this "silent success" behavior.
    - Fixed test setup to correctly mirror the Upstream (Bare) -> Maintainer -> Local workflow.
